# Projects Phase 1 - Quick Start Guide 🚀

**Status:** ✅ Implementation Complete - Ready for Testing

---

## What Was Built

Your Projects feature now **works**! Users can:
- 🎯 Open projects and load files
- 💾 Auto-save file changes every 30 seconds
- 🔄 Resume work from where they left off
- 📱 Access projects from any device (with same login)

---

## 🔥 Quick Setup (3 steps)

### 1. Apply Database Migration

**Option A: Via Supabase Dashboard**
1. Go to your Supabase project → SQL Editor
2. Open `docs/project/PROJECTS_PHASE1_MIGRATION.sql`
3. Copy and paste the entire SQL file
4. Click "Run"

**Option B: Via Supabase CLI**
```bash
supabase db push
```

### 2. Test It

```bash
# Start your dev server
npm run dev
```

**Test Flow:**
1. Sign in to your app
2. Go to Projects page (`/projects`)
3. Create a new project
4. Click "Open Project"
5. Start chatting with AI to generate files
6. Wait 30 seconds (auto-save happens)
7. Close the tab
8. Reopen the project
9. ✅ Files should restore automatically!

### 3. Verify in Browser Console

Open browser DevTools and check for these logs:
```
[ProjectStore] Project selected: {id}
[ChatHistory] Loading project files for project: {id}
[ChatHistory] Found X files in project, starting restoration...
[ProjectAutoSave] Auto-saving X files to project {id}
[ProjectAutoSave] Successfully auto-saved X files
```

## 📋 What Got Changed

### New Files
- `docs/project/PROJECTS_PHASE1_MIGRATION.sql` - Database schema
- `app/lib/hooks/useProjectAutoSave.ts` - Auto-save logic
- `docs/project/PROJECTS_PHASE1_COMPLETE.md` - Full documentation

### Modified Files
- `app/lib/services/projects.ts` - File operations
- `app/components/projects/ProjectsList.tsx` - Opening flow
- `app/lib/persistence/useChatHistory.ts` - Project file loading
- `app/routes/_index.tsx` - Route loader
- `app/routes/chat.$id.tsx` - Route loader  
- `app/components/chat/Chat.client.tsx` - Auto-save integration

---

## 🎯 How Users Will Experience It

### Before (Broken)
```
User: *clicks "Open Project"*
App: *shows metadata page*
User: "Where are my files? 😕"
```

### After (Working!)
```
User: *clicks "Open Project"*
App: "Loading project workspace..." 🔄
     *restores files*
     *opens workbench*
User: "My files are here! 🎉"
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Projects feature is not yet provisioned"
→ Run the migration SQL file

### Files don't load
→ Check browser console for errors
→ Verify `file_state` column exists in Supabase

### Auto-save not working
→ Check: User is signed in
→ Check: Project is opened (not just viewing metadata)
→ Look for "Auto-saving" logs in console
