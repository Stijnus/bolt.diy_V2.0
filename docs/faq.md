# ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

Common questions and answers about BoltDIY V2.0.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Q: What is BoltDIY V2.0?
**A:** BoltDIY V2.0 is an enhanced version of Bolt.new that adds multi-model AI support (19+ models from 6 providers), Supabase authentication, cloud-synced chat history, and modern UI components. It's a complete AI development platform that runs in your browser.

### Q: How is this different from the original Bolt.new?
**A:** Key differences include:
- **Multi-Model AI**: 19+ models vs just Claude
- **Authentication**: User accounts with Supabase
- **Cloud Sync**: Chat history saved across devices  
- **Modern UI**: Radix UI components with better UX
- **Enhanced Settings**: Complete configuration control

### Q: Do I need to pay for AI models?
**A:** Yes, you need API keys from AI providers. However:
- Most providers offer free credits to start
- DeepSeek models are extremely cost-effective ($0.14-0.28 per 1M tokens)
- You only pay for what you use
- Many models cost less than $1 per hour of heavy usage

### Q: What's the minimum setup to get started?
**A:** You need:
- Anthropic API key (required)
- Supabase account (free tier)
- Node.js >= 18.18.0
- About 10 minutes for setup

## ü§ñ AI Models & Providers

### Q: Which AI model should I use?
**A:** Depends on your needs:
- **Fast development**: Grok Code Fast 1, Gemini Flash

- **Budget-friendly**: DeepSeek V3.2, Reasoner
- **Large codebases**: Gemini 2.5 Pro (1M context), Codestral

### Q: Can I use multiple models in the same project?
**A:** Absolutely! You can switch models mid-conversation. Many users start with fast models for scaffolding, then switch to more powerful models for complex logic.

### Q: What if I only have one API key?
**A:** That's fine! BoltDIY works with just Anthropic. You can add other providers later. The interface will show which models are available based on your API keys.

### Q: Are there free AI models I can use?
**A:** While the models themselves aren't free, many providers offer generous free credits:
- Anthropic: $5 free credits
- OpenAI: $5 free credits for new accounts
- Google: Free tier with quotas
- DeepSeek: Very low costs (often under $1 for extensive use)

### Q: What's the most cost-effective setup?
**A:** For maximum value:
1. **Primary**: DeepSeek V3.2 (90% capability, 10% cost)
2. **Backup**: Anthropic Claude for complex issues
3. **Speed**: Grok Code Fast 1 for iterations
4. **Research**: Google Gemini 2.5 Pro for large context
